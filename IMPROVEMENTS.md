# Improvements


## Layout


- It would be nice to have different views for the email list. Example:
	
	> Email list on the left (like left nav) and Email content/detail on the right. This can be divided into two 30% left nav email list and 70% right email details.
- It would be nice to have different filter options. Example:
	> A dropdown list would be great to choose which filter options are we using. Either 'all', 'subject', or 'from' etc. 
	

## UX

- It would be nice to have different background color for email list of rows. This is to distinguish one email list item to the other. This also helps accessibility for all users, it gives contrast. Example:
	
	> First Row which is 'odd' will be white and 'even' row would be light grey
	
- It would be nice to have consistent date format. Example:
	
	> If we are using this format 'Jan 01, 2020' then use this format across all email content for consistency.
- It would be nice to have different theme options. Example:
	
	> Dark mode. Some users prefer dark over light colored theme. This is to give them options based on their preference.
